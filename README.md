# Java Practical Test Assignment

This project aims to implement a RESTful API based on a Spring Boot web application, specifically focusing on a controller responsible for managing resources related to users.

## Getting Started

To complete this task, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Learn about RESTful API:**
   Familiarize yourself with RESTful API principles and best practices using the resources provided below:

    - [RESTful API Design: Best Practices in a Nutshell](https://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api)
    - [Error Handling for REST with Spring | Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/exception-handling-for-rest-with-spring)
    - [Testing in Spring Boot | Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-testing)
    - [Testing | Spring](https://spring.io/guides/gs/testing-web/)

2. **Implementation:**
   Implement the RESTful API based on the given requirements. The API should include functionality to perform CRUD operations on user resources.

3. **Requirements:**
   Ensure that your implementation meets the following requirements:

    - Define user resources with fields such as email, first name, last name, birth date, address, and phone number, with appropriate validations.
    - Implement functionalities for creating, updating, and deleting users, as well as searching for users by birth date range.
    - Write unit tests using Spring to ensure code coverage.
    - Implement error handling for RESTful responses.
    - Return API responses in JSON format.
    - Database usage is optional; the data persistence layer is not required.
    - Use any version of Spring Boot and Java according to your preference.

## Usage

To use the API, follow the endpoint documentation provided by the implemented controller. Ensure that you provide valid input data and adhere to the API guidelines specified in the requirements.
